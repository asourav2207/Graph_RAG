The programme seeks to transform India into a global manufacturing hub by simplifying regulatory procedures, enhancing ease of doing business, and offering incentives such as tax breaks, infrastructure development, and skill‑training support. As a central pillar of the nation’s economic policy, Make In India is frequently referenced in current‑affairs interviews, group discussions (GD) and written ability tests (WAT), where candidates are asked to evaluate its impact on employment, export growth, and overall economic development. The initiative underscores the government’s broader vision of boosting industrial output, reducing import dependence, and creating high‑value jobs, thereby positioning India as a competitive alternative to traditional manufacturing bases.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": null, "reasoning_content": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 222, "prompt_tokens": 261, "total_tokens": 483, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}}}
