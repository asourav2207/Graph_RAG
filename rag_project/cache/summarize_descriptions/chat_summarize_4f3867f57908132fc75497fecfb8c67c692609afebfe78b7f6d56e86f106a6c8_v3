In the Indian context, Net Neutrality has become a prominent issue in public discourse, frequently surfacing in current‑affairs discussions, media analysis, and as a potential interview topic for candidates seeking positions that require knowledge of contemporary policy debates. The principle emphasizes that all online traffic—whether from streaming services, social media platforms, messaging apps, or any other source—should be subject to the same standards of speed, access, and cost, preventing ISPs from creating “fast lanes” for certain services or throttling competitors. The debate in India has centered on balancing the need for a free and open internet with legitimate network management practices, and it continues to influence regulatory considerations, consumer awareness, and the broader conversation about digital rights and the future of the Indian internet ecosystem.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": null, "reasoning_content": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 239, "prompt_tokens": 253, "total_tokens": 492, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}}}
