It is a one‑to‑one or panel‑based assessment conducted after candidates have cleared earlier selection stages such as the Common Admission Test (CAT) and Written Ability Test (WAT).  \n\nDuring the PI, interviewers probe the candidate’s background, motivations, career aspirations, and personality traits. Typical questions include “Tell me about yourself,” discussions of strengths and weaknesses, and the candidate’s rationale for pursuing an MBA. The interview also evaluates communication skills, confidence, analytical thinking, and problem‑solving abilities.  \n\nThe personal interview thus serves as a comprehensive gateway, allowing IIMs and other top Indian B‑schools to gauge whether a candidate possesses the interpersonal and intellectual qualities required for success in a rigorous two‑year management program. It is the last opportunity for applicants to make a strong impression before admission decisions are finalized.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": null, "reasoning_content": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 270, "prompt_tokens": 329, "total_tokens": 599, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}}}
