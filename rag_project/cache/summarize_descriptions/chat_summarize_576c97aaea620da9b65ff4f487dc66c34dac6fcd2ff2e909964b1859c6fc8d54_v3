It has also been adopted by the Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad (IIM‑A) as a tool for evaluating candidates’ critical‑reasoning abilities. In the AWT, test‑takers are required to produce a well‑structured essay in which they analyze either a specific issue or an argument, demonstrating their capacity to think logically, assess evidence, and articulate a reasoned response. The test measures the ability to construct coherent arguments, identify underlying assumptions, and present clear, persuasive writing. By incorporating the AWT, both the GMAT and IIM‑A aim to gauge a candidate’s analytical writing skills and readiness for advanced business study.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": null, "reasoning_content": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 322, "prompt_tokens": 260, "total_tokens": 582, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}}}
