Throughout this period, each IIM campus conducts face‑to‑face interviews with applicants, evaluates their suitability for the management programmes, and uses the interview performance—along with other admission criteria—to make final admission decisions. The interview season therefore symbolizes the critical stage in the IIM admissions cycle when candidates are assessed directly by faculty and admissions committees, and it ultimately determines which applicants secure a place in the prestigious MBA programmes offered by the IIMs.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": null, "reasoning_content": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 180, "prompt_tokens": 276, "total_tokens": 456, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}}}
