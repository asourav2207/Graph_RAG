Renowned for its rigorous academic standards and competitive admissions process, IIM‑A offers a flagship two‑year MBA programme that attracts top talent from across the country and abroad.  \n\nFor admissions, the institute employs a multi‑stage evaluation that includes the Analytical Writing Test (AWT) – often referred to as the WAT – and a personal interview. The AWT assesses candidates’ ability to articulate ideas clearly and think analytically under time pressure, while the personal interview gauges fit, leadership potential, and communication skills. In addition to these components, IIM‑A’s group discussion (GD) and written ability test (WAT) typically focus on short, subjective topics, enabling evaluators to gauge depth of understanding, reasoning, and the ability to present concise arguments.  \n\nOverall, IIM‑A combines a distinguished academic reputation with a comprehensive, skills‑oriented admissions process that emphasizes analytical writing, personal interaction, and concise subjective discourse.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": null, "reasoning_content": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 353, "prompt_tokens": 286, "total_tokens": 639, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}}}
