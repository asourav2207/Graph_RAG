This essay‑type component requires test‑takers to read a brief argument presented in a short passage, evaluate its logical structure, identify assumptions, assess the strength of the evidence, and suggest ways the argument could be improved or weakened. The **Analysis of an Argument** is therefore a distinct writing task within the broader GMAT exam, designed to measure a candidate’s ability to think critically and communicate ideas clearly under timed conditions. Both entities—the GMAT and the Analysis of an Argument—are linked by this requirement, making the essay a core element of the test’s assessment of analytical writing skills.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": null, "reasoning_content": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 305, "prompt_tokens": 240, "total_tokens": 545, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}}}
