Administered annually, CAT assesses candidates on quantitative ability, data interpretation, verbal reasoning, and logical problem‑solving. The exam’s percentile‑based scorecard is the key metric used by Indian MBA programmes to shortlist applicants; high‑scoring candidates are invited to the second stage of the selection process, which typically comprises written ability tests (WAT), group discussions (GD), and personal interviews (PI). As a competitive, high‑stakes test, CAT functions as the main filter that determines eligibility for admission to India’s premier management institutes and many other B‑schools across the country.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": null, "reasoning_content": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 266, "prompt_tokens": 290, "total_tokens": 556, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}}}
