Spanning several weeks across the country, this season involves a coordinated series of interview sessions held at each IIM’s campus. Candidates who have cleared the written tests and other preliminary screening stages are shortlisted and invited to participate in these interviews.\n\nDuring the season, each IIM—such as IIM Ahmedabad, IIM Bangalore, IIM Calcutta, and others—organises multiple interview rounds to assess a range of attributes, including academic aptitude, leadership potential, communication skills, and overall fit with the institute’s values. The process typically begins with a group discussion or a panel interview, followed by one‑to‑one sessions with senior faculty or alumni. Some institutes, like IIM‑A, may also incorporate case studies or situational judgment tests as part of their interview framework.\n\nThe IIM Interview Season is a critical phase of the admission cycle, as it allows the institutes to gauge candidates beyond quantitative scores and to ensure a holistic selection. It also provides applicants with an opportunity to learn more about the institute’s culture, faculty, and peer group. The season concludes with the release of final admission offers, after which successful candidates complete the necessary paperwork and prepare for the start of their postgraduate studies.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "reasoning_content": "We need to produce a comprehensive summary of the data.
