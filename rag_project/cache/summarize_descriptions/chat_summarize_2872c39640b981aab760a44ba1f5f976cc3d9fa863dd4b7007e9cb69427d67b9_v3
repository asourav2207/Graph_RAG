The prompt asks test‑takers to identify assumptions, evaluate the logical structure, spot weaknesses, and suggest ways the argument could be strengthened. It is most widely known as the core essay of the Analytical Writing Assessment (AWA) component of the Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT), where candidates produce a 30‑minute analysis. The same format is also employed in the Analytical Writing Test (AWT) used by the Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad (IIM‑A) and other business‑school admissions exams, mirroring the GMAT’s requirements.\n\nIn both contexts, the task does not require test‑takers to agree or disagree with the argument’s conclusion; instead, they must focus exclusively on the quality of the argument’s logic and evidence. Typical scoring rubrics evaluate clarity of expression, organization, depth of analysis, and the ability to articulate relevant critiques and improvements. Successful submissions demonstrate a clear structure—usually an introduction that restates the argument’s main claim, body paragraphs that dissect specific logical flaws or unstated assumptions, and a conclusion that summarizes the evaluation and offers constructive suggestions.\n\nThus, **Analysis of an Argument** serves as a universal essay prompt across major graduate‑admissions assessments, designed to gauge a candidate’s critical‑thinking and written‑communication skills by having them evaluate a short, often deliberately flawed, argument.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": null, "reasoning_content": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 478, "prompt_tokens": 266, "total_tokens": 744, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}}}
