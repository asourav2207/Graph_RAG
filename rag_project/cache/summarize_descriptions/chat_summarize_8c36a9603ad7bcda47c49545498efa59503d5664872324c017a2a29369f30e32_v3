In its admissions and evaluation process, IIFT distinguishes itself by emphasizing policy‑based, information‑heavy, and data‑driven topics in both the Group Discussion (GD) and Written Ability Test (WAT). Candidates can expect prompts that require a solid grounding in current trade policies, statistical evidence, and analytical reasoning, rather than the case‑study or opinion‑based style commonly associated with institutions such as IIM Ahmedabad. This focus reflects IIFT’s broader academic orientation toward quantitative analysis and macro‑economic policy, aligning its curriculum and assessment methods with the practical demands of international trade and business strategy. Consequently, IIFT attracts aspirants who are comfortable interpreting complex data sets, constructing evidence‑based arguments, and articulating nuanced policy insights.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": null, "reasoning_content": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 410, "prompt_tokens": 264, "total_tokens": 674, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}}}
