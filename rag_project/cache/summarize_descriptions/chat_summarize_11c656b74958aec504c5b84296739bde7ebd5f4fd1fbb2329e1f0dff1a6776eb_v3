It stems from the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere due to human activities such as fossil‑fuel combustion, deforestation, and industrial processes. The phenomenon has far‑reaching policy implications, prompting governments, businesses, and civil societies to develop mitigation strategies (e.g., carbon pricing, renewable‑energy transitions) and adaptation measures (e.g., resilient infrastructure, climate‑smart agriculture). Because of its profound impact on economies, security, and public health, Climate Change is a frequent topic in current‑affairs group‑discussion (GD) and written‑ability‑test (WAT) examinations, as well as a common subject of inquiry in MBA interviews, where candidates are expected to demonstrate awareness of sustainability challenges and strategic responses.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": null, "reasoning_content": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 272, "prompt_tokens": 242, "total_tokens": 514, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}}}
