Recognized as the country’s premier management education institutions, the IIMs collectively design, deliver and continuously evolve a wide array of postgraduate and executive programmes, including the flagship two‑year Master of Business Administration (MBA), the one‑year Post‑Graduate Programme for Executives (PGP‑X), and numerous specialised short‑duration executive courses.  \n\nIn addition to their academic offerings, the IIMs are known for a rigorous admissions process that places a strong emphasis on candidate evaluation through issue‑based Group Discussion (GD) and Written Ability Test (WAT) components. These assessments are crafted to gauge applicants’ analytical thinking, communication skills, and ability to articulate viewpoints on contemporary business and socio‑economic topics.  \n\nOperating under a common brand yet maintaining individual autonomy, each IIM tailors its curriculum, faculty expertise, and industry collaborations to regional strengths while adhering to the overall standards that define the IIM group. This collaborative framework enables the IIMs to serve a diverse pool of aspiring managers and seasoned professionals, contributing significantly to India’s talent pipeline and the global business community.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": null, "reasoning_content": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 411, "prompt_tokens": 254, "total_tokens": 665, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}}}
