It features a series of workshops, seminars, and conferences, including the IMS NAW (National Academic Week hosted by the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad). The week is designed to foster interdisciplinary dialogue, showcase cutting‑edge research, and promote collaborative projects among scholars and students nationwide.  \n\n2. **National Academic Workshop (NAW)** – Organized by IIM‑A, this workshop focuses on deepening academic engagement between students and faculty. It offers a platform for faculty to present their latest research, for students to discuss emerging trends, and for both groups to collaborate on joint projects. The workshop is typically held during the National Academic Week but can also occur independently as a standalone event.  \n\n3. **National Achievers Workshop (NAW)** – A two‑weekend program that travels to six major Indian cities. It is specifically aimed at MBA aspirants, providing intensive preparation for interviews, panel discussions, and case‑study analyses. The workshop combines expert coaching, mock interviews, and networking opportunities with industry leaders, thereby equipping participants with the skills needed to excel in competitive MBA admissions.  \n\nBy integrating these three components, NAW serves as a comprehensive academic ecosystem: the National Academic Week offers a broad platform for scholarly exchange; the National Academic Workshop deepens faculty‑student collaboration; and the National Achievers Workshop equips future business leaders with practical interview and discussion skills. Together, they reinforce India’s commitment to academic excellence, research innovation, and professional development.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "reasoning_content": "We need to produce a comprehensive summary of the data.
