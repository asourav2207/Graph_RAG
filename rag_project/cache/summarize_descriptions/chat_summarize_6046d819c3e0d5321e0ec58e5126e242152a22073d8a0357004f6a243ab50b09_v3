Renowned for its rigorous academic standards and competitive admissions, IIM‑A offers flagship programmes such as the two‑year MBA and the executive‑focused PGP‑X. As part of its selection process, the institute conducts personal interviews for candidates to these programmes. Unlike many other IIMs that use a Written Ability Test (WAT), IIM‑A replaces the WAT with an Analytical Writing Test (AWT), assessing candidates’ ability to think critically and articulate ideas in a structured written format. This distinctive component, combined with the interview, forms the core of IIM‑A’s comprehensive evaluation of prospective MBA and PGP‑X students.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": null, "reasoning_content": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 317, "prompt_tokens": 275, "total_tokens": 592, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}}}
