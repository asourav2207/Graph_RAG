It is a traditional written examination that evaluates candidates’ ability to construct clear, coherent, and well‑structured essays. In addition to assessing expression and writing mechanics, the WAT also measures logical reasoning skills and the applicant’s awareness of current affairs, requiring test‑takers to present reasoned arguments on contemporary topics within a limited time frame. This dual focus on both language proficiency and analytical thinking makes the WAT a crucial tool for distinguishing candidates who can effectively communicate ideas and demonstrate insightful, up‑to‑date knowledge of the business environment.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": null, "reasoning_content": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 231, "prompt_tokens": 261, "total_tokens": 492, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}}}
