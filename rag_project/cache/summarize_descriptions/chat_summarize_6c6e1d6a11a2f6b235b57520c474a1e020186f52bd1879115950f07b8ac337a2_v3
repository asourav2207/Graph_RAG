Conducted annually, the standardized test evaluates candidates’ quantitative ability, verbal reasoning, data interpretation, and logical skills. The percentile scores obtained by test‑takers form the primary metric that leading business schools—including the Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs) such as IIM Ahmedabad, IIM Bangalore, and IIM Calcutta—use to shortlist applicants. For these institutes, a high CAT percentile is the first step in the selection pipeline; it determines who proceeds to the second‑stage assessments that typically consist of a Written Ability Test (WAT), Group Discussion (GD), and Personal Interview (PI). Thus, CAT functions not only as a screening tool but also as the trigger for the comprehensive, multi‑phase admission process employed by India’s top management schools.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": null, "reasoning_content": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 305, "prompt_tokens": 282, "total_tokens": 587, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}}}
