Launched as a flagship urban‑development initiative, it seeks to integrate advanced technologies, efficient infrastructure, and inclusive planning to improve the quality of life for residents while minimizing environmental impact. The program emphasizes smart governance, renewable energy, waste management, and digital services, encouraging collaboration between central and state authorities, local bodies, and private partners. Because of its relevance to contemporary urban policy, Smart Cities frequently appears in group discussions (GD) and written ability tests (WAT), and is often highlighted as a potential interview question for candidates interested in public administration, urban planning, or related fields.
