During this period, prospective students who have cleared the initial stages of the selection process, such as the Common Admission Test (CAT) and written ability tests, are invited to appear before faculty panels and admission committees. The interview component serves as a crucial evaluation step, allowing the institutes to assess candidates’ communication skills, leadership potential, analytical abilities, personal motivations, and overall fit with the IIM’s academic environment. The IIM Interview Season typically aligns with each institute’s academic calendar and may vary slightly across the different IIM campuses, but it universally represents the final gatekeeper in the admission pipeline for MBA aspirants.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": null, "reasoning_content": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 214, "prompt_tokens": 241, "total_tokens": 455, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}}}
