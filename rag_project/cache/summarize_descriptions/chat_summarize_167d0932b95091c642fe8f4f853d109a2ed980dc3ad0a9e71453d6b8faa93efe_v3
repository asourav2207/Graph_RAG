During the IIM interview season, candidates who have cleared the written tests are invited to individual interview sessions. These sessions are designed to assess a range of attributes, including academic aptitude, leadership potential, communication skills, and overall fit with the IIM culture. Each interview is conducted by a panel of faculty members and industry professionals, who evaluate the candidate’s responses to situational, behavioral, and technical questions. The interview serves as a critical component of the overall selection process, allowing the IIMs to gauge a candidate’s motivation, problem‑solving abilities, and interpersonal skills beyond what is captured in written examinations. Successful candidates are those who demonstrate a strong blend of analytical thinking, strategic insight, and a clear understanding of how an MBA from an IIM will help them achieve their career goals.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "reasoning_content": "We need to produce a comprehensive summary of the data.
