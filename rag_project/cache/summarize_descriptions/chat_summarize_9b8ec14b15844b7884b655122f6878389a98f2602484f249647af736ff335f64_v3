While the event is organized by the Indian Management Society, it also features a distinctive iteration hosted by IIM Ahmedabad (IIM‑A). This IIM‑A edition focuses specifically on management studies, offering participants in-depth sessions on contemporary management theories, case studies, and practical applications. Across all iterations, IMS NAW serves as a platform for knowledge exchange, skill development, and professional networking, bridging academia and industry. The event’s structure typically includes keynote addresses from thought leaders, panel discussions, interactive workshops, and poster presentations, ensuring a comprehensive learning experience for attendees. By combining the broader national scope of the Indian Management Society with the specialized focus of IIM‑A’s management workshop, IMS NAW delivers a unique blend of academic rigor and industry relevance, fostering collaboration and innovation within the management education community.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "reasoning_content": "We need to produce a comprehensive summary of the entity \"IMS NAW\" from the two descriptions.
