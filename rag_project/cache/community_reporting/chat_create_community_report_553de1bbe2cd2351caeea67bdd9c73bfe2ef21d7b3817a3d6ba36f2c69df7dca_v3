The IIMs operate as a coordinated network of premier Indian management schools, while ISB functions as a competing top‑tier business school. Both the IIMs and ISB reference the PGP‑X programme, which is a 1‑year postgraduate management offering; however, the programme is viewed as less prestigious when compared to ISB's own offerings.
