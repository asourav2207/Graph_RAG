These relationships demonstrate that IIMA orchestrates the flow of candidates across multiple assessment stages, establishing a tightly coupled admission system [Data: Entities (53); Relationships (29,31)].\\n\\nBecause IIMA is a premier business school, its admission criteria set benchmarks for other Indian management institutes, amplifying the broader influence of the pipeline beyond its own campus.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"CAT as the primary screening mechanism\",\n            \"explanation\": \"The Common Admission Test (CAT) functions as the first gatekeeper for MBA aspirants, providing a quantitative and verbal score that IIMA leverages to shortlist applicants. This dependency is explicit: IIMA uses CAT scores for shortlisting, and CAT scores determine eligibility for the subsequent PI/GD/WAT processes. Consequently, CAT acts as the trigger that activates the downstream assessments, making it a critical control point in the admission workflow [Data: Entities (54); Relationships (29,32)].\\n\\nGiven CAT’s nationwide reach and its role in determining who proceeds, any changes in its format or scoring methodology can ripple through the entire community, affecting preparation markets and candidate demographics.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"Written Ability Test (WAT) evaluates analytical writing and reasoning\",\n            \"explanation\": \"The Written Ability Test (WAT) assesses candidates’ ability to construct coherent essays, blend language proficiency with logical reasoning, and demonstrate awareness of current affairs.
