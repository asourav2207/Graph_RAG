IIM‑A orchestrates a series of workshops—most notably Achievers Workshops—within the broader Indian Management Society National Academic Week (IMS NAW). The AWT incorporates critical reasoning (CR) and draws parallels to the GMAT, while also embedding arguments such as tourism restrictions. Relationships among NGOs, government bodies, and the institute illustrate the institution’s engagement with external stakeholders. Overall, the community is academically oriented, with strong internal linkages and limited external conflict potential.\",\n    \"rating\": 2.0,\n    \"rating_explanation\": \"The impact severity rating is low because the entities are primarily educational and collaborative, posing minimal risk of adverse events.\",\n    \"findings\": [\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"IIM‑A is the central hub administering the AWT and WAT.\",\n            \"explanation\": \"IIM‑A serves as the primary institution that designs and conducts both the Admission Written Test (AWT) and the Writing Assessment Task (WAT), which are integral components of its rigorous admission process. The relationships between IIM‑A and these assessment tools are explicitly documented, with IIM‑A directly administering the AWT (Relationship 19) and the WAT (Relationship 20). Furthermore, the AWT and WAT are linked as part of the same interview assessment (Relationship 24). These connections underscore IIM‑A’s central role in shaping candidate evaluation and maintaining academic standards.

The AWT’s design is also compared to the GMAT, a globally recognized business school admission test, through the relationship linking the AWT to GMAT (Relationship 30). This alignment suggests that IIM‑A’s assessment framework is calibrated to international benchmarks, ensuring that admitted students meet high analytical standards. The inclusion of CR and GMAT parallels enhances the credibility and comparability of IIM‑A’s admission criteria.

This is captured by the relationship between the AWT and the tourism entity (Relationship 32).
