Relationships link CAT scores to IIMA eligibility, interview sub‑questions to each other, and GD to WAT as complementary non‑interview assessments.

IIMA uses CAT percentile scores to filter applicants and conducts the personal interview that includes the standard \\\"Tell me about yourself\\\" question.
