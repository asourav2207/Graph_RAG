Actually cathelpdesk@iimk.ac.in, cathelpdesk@iimcat.co.in. IIMK is Indian Institute of Management Kozhikode? Actually IIMK is IIM Kozhikode. So IIMK is an organization. Also IIMs collectively. Also IIMs and Non-IIM member institutions. So IIMs is organization. Non-IIM member institutions (organization? maybe group).

Not necessary.\n\nWe need to produce relationships among these entities that are clearly related.\n\nPossible relationships:\n\n- ADITYA SOURAV is a candidate for CAT 2025. So relationship: ADITYA SOURAV -> CAT 2025 (candidate for). Strength maybe 9.\n\n- ADITYA SOURAV lives in LALPANIA, Bokaro, Jharkhand. So relationship: ADITYA SOURAV -> LALPANIA (residence). Strength 8.\n\n- LALPANIA is in Bokaro district. So LALPANIA -> Bokaro (located in). Strength 9.\n\n- Bokaro is in Jharkhand. So Bokaro -> Jharkhand (located in). Strength 9.\n\n- CAT 2025 is part of Common Admission Test. So CAT 2025 -> Common Admission Test (subset).

We need to ensure each entity is unique. We need to use uppercase for entity_name. For entity_type, we need to use one of organization, person, geo, event. For event, we can use \"CAT 2025\" and \"Common Admission Test\". For geo, we can use \"LALPANIA\", \"BOKARO\", \"JHARKHAND\". For organization, we can use \"INDIAN INSTITUTES OF MANAGEMENT\", \"IIMs\", \"Non-IIM member institutions\", \"CAT Centre\", \"IIMK\". For person, \"ADITYA SOURAV\".\n\nWe might also include \"CAT 2025 SCORE CARD\" as event? But it's a document. But we can treat as event?

For entity_type, we need to use one of organization, person, geo, event. For event, we can use \"event\". For organization, \"organization\". For person, \"person\". For geo, \"geo\".\n\nWe need to ensure entity_name is capitalized. For example, \"CAT 2025\" is fine. \"COMMON ADMISSION TEST\" is fine. \"INDIAN INSTITUTES OF MANAGEMENT\" is fine. \"IIMS\" is fine. \"NON-IIM MEMBER INSTITUTIONS\" is fine. \"CAT CENTRE\" is fine. \"IIMK\" is fine. \"ADITYA SOURAV\" is fine. \"LALPANIA\" is fine. \"BOKARO\" is fine. \"JHARKHAND\" is fine. \"30TH NOVEMBER 2025\" is fine. \"31ST DEC 2026\" is fine. \"31ST MARCH 2026\" is fine.\n\nNow we need to produce the output.

Actually cathelpdesk@iimk.ac.in, cathelpdesk@iimcat.co.in. IIMK is Indian Institute of Management Kozhikode? Actually IIMK is IIM Kozhikode. So IIMK is an organization. Also IIMs collectively. Also IIMs and Non-IIM member institutions. So IIMs is organization. Non-IIM member institutions (organization? maybe group). But we can include IIMK.\n\n- The email addresses: cat2025_helpdesk@iimk.ac.in, cathelpdesk@iimcat.co.in.

Not necessary.\n\nWe need to produce relationships among these entities that are clearly related.\n\nPossible relationships:\n\n- ADITYA SOURAV is a candidate for CAT 2025. So relationship: ADITYA SOURAV -> CAT 2025 (candidate for). Strength maybe 9.\n\n- ADITYA SOURAV lives in LALPANIA, Bokaro, Jharkhand. So relationship: ADITYA SOURAV -> LALPANIA (residence). Strength 8.\n\n- LALPANIA is in Bokaro district. So LALPANIA -> Bokaro (located in). Strength 9.\n\n- Bokaro is in Jharkhand. So Bokaro -> Jharkhand (located in). Strength 9.\n\n- CAT 2025 is part of Common Admission Test. So CAT 2025 -> Common Admission Test (subset). Strength 9.\n\n- Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs) are institutions that use CAT 2025 scores. So Indian Institutes of Management -> CAT 2025 (use scores). Strength 8.\n\n- IIMs and Non-IIM member institutions decide how to use CAT 2025 scores. So IIMs -> Non-IIM member institutions (collaborate). Strength 7.\n\n- CAT Centre is responsible for CAT 2025.

So Score Card -> 31st Dec 2026 (validity). Strength 8.\n\n- The helpdesk is available until 31st March 2026. So Helpdesk -> 31st March 2026 (availability). Strength 8.\n\n- The candidate's email is asambias.2014@gmail.com. Not entity.\n\n- The candidate's contact details: D-5/27 TTPS COLONY. Not entity.\n\n- The candidate's gender: Male NC-OBC.

For entity_type, we need to use one of organization, person, geo, event. For event, we can use \"event\". For organization, \"organization\". For person, \"person\". For geo, \"geo\".\n\nWe need to ensure entity_name is capitalized. For example, \"CAT 2025\" is fine. \"COMMON ADMISSION TEST\" is fine. \"INDIAN INSTITUTES OF MANAGEMENT\" is fine. \"IIMS\" is fine. \"NON-IIM MEMBER INSTITUTIONS\" is fine. \"CAT CENTRE\" is fine. \"IIMK\" is fine. \"ADITYA SOURAV\" is fine. \"LALPANIA\" is fine. \"BOKARO\" is fine. \"JHARKHAND\" is fine. \"30TH NOVEMBER 2025\" is fine. \"31ST DEC 2026\" is fine. \"31ST MARCH 2026\" is fine.\n\nNow we need to produce the output.

The text is about CAT 2025, Common Admission Test, Indian Institutes of Management, candidate details, etc. We need to identify entities of types organization, person, geo, event. The text includes:\n\n- CAT 2025 (event)\n- Common Admission Test (event)\n- Indian Institutes of Management (organization)\n- Candidate: ADITYA SOURAV (person)\n- D-5/27 TTPS COLONY, LALPANIA (address, but maybe geo: LALPANIA, Bokaro district, Jharkhand state)\n- LALPANIA (geo)\n- Bokaro (district)\n- Jharkhand (state)\n- IIMs (organization)\n- IIMK? Actually cathelpdesk@iimk.ac.in, cathelpdesk@iimcat.co.in. IIMK is Indian Institute of Management Kozhikode? Actually IIMK is IIM Kozhikode. So IIMK is an organization. Also IIMs collectively. Also IIMs and Non-IIM member institutions. So IIMs is organization. Non-IIM member institutions (organization? maybe group). But we can include IIMK.\n\n- The email addresses: cat2025_helpdesk@iimk.ac.in, cathelpdesk@iimcat.co.in. But not needed.\n\n- The website: https://iimcat.ac.in\n\n- The date: 30th November 2025 (date of test). But event date.\n\n- The date of birth: 22/Sep/1999.\n\n- The candidate's contact details: D-5/27 TTPS COLONY, LALPANIA. So address.\n\n- The candidate's email: asambias.2014@gmail.com\n\n- The candidate's gender: Male NC-OBC.\n\n- The candidate's score: various.\n\n- The instructions mention \"IIMs and Non-IIM member institutions independently decide how to use CAT 2025 scores in line with their own selection process.\" So IIMs and Non-IIM member institutions are organizations.\n\n- \"CAT Centre will not answer post-CAT queries.\" So CAT Centre is an organization? Might be an entity.\n\n- \"CAT 2025 score is valid only until 31st Dec 2026.\" So date.\n\n- \"The score card will be available on https://iimcat.ac.in till 31st Dec 2026 to download.\" So website.\n\n- \"Webmail support on cat2025_helpdesk@iimk.ac.in & cathelpdesk@iimcat.co.in will be available till 31st March 2026.\" So date.\n\n- \"© Copyright CAT IIM 2025\" So maybe \"CAT IIM 2025\" is an entity?

Indian Institutes of Management (organization)\n4. IIMs (organization) maybe same as Indian Institutes of Management? But we can treat as same. But we can list \"IIMs\" as organization.\n5. Non-IIM member institutions (organization)\n6. CAT Centre (organization)\n7. IIMK (Indian Institute of Management Kozhikode) (organization)\n8. IIMCAT (maybe the website? Actually \"iimcat.ac.in\" is the website for CAT. But we can treat \"IIMCAT\" as organization? Might be \"IIMCAT\" as brand. But we can skip.\n9. ADITYA SOURAV (person)\n10. LALPANIA (geo)\n11.

Actually \"5202 TAC\" repeated. Might be some code. But not entity.\n\nWe might also include \"CAT 2025 Score Card\" as event? But it's a document. But we can treat as event? Not necessary.\n\nWe need to produce relationships among these entities that are clearly related.\n\nPossible relationships:\n\n- ADITYA SOURAV is a candidate for CAT 2025. So relationship: ADITYA SOURAV -> CAT 2025 (candidate for). Strength maybe 9.\n\n- ADITYA SOURAV lives in LALPANIA, Bokaro, Jharkhand. So relationship: ADITYA SOURAV -> LALPANIA (residence). Strength 8.\n\n- LALPANIA is in Bokaro district. So LALPANIA -> Bokaro (located in). Strength 9.\n\n- Bokaro is in Jharkhand. So Bokaro -> Jharkhand (located in). Strength 9.\n\n- CAT 2025 is part of Common Admission Test. So CAT 2025 -> Common Admission Test (subset). Strength 9.\n\n- Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs) are institutions that use CAT 2025 scores. So Indian Institutes of Management -> CAT 2025 (use scores). Strength 8.\n\n- IIMs and Non-IIM member institutions decide how to use CAT 2025 scores. So IIMs -> Non-IIM member institutions (collaborate). Strength 7.\n\n- CAT Centre is responsible for CAT 2025.
