Not necessary. \"NAW\" event. \"National Achievers Workshop\" event. \"IIMB SOP Prompt\" event. \"Test Match cricket\" event. \"ODI\" event. \"T20\" event. \"Gully Cricket\" event. \"IIMB\" organization. \"IMS\" organization. \"B-schools\" maybe organization? Might skip. \"IIMB\" organization. \"IMS\" organization. \"NAW\" event. \"National Achievers Workshop\" event. \"IIMB SOP Prompt\" event. \"Test Match cricket\" event. \"ODI\" event. \"T20\" event. \"Gully Cricket\" event. \"IIMB\" organization. \"IMS\" organization. \"NAW\" event. \"National Achievers Workshop\" event. \"IIMB SOP Prompt\" event. \"Test Match cricket\" event. \"ODI\" event. \"T20\" event. \"Gully Cricket\" event. \"IIMB\" organization. \"IMS\" organization. \"NAW\" event. \"National Achievers Workshop\" event. \"IIMB SOP Prompt\" event. \"Test Match cricket\" event. \"ODI\" event. \"T20\" event. \"Gully Cricket\" event. \"IIMB\" organization. \"IMS\" organization. \"NAW\" event. \"National Achievers Workshop\" event. \"IIMB SOP Prompt\" event. \"Test Match cricket\" event. \"ODI\" event. \"T20\" event. \"Gully Cricket\" event. Enough.\n\nNow relationships: IIMB is organization that hosts NAW? Actually NAW is organized by IMS? The text: \"Attend the National Achievers Workshop to test and strengthen these answers\" and \"Those of you with Top 30 Calls should attend the IMS National Achievers Workshop (NAW) that will be held across 6 cities — Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore, Kolkata, and Hyderabad on two weekends 2-3 February and 9-10 February.\" So NAW is organized by IMS. So relationship: NAW <-> IMS. NAW <-> IIMB? Not directly. IIMB is an institution that gives SOP prompts. So relationship: IIMB <-> IIMB SOP Prompt. IIMB <-> B-schools? Not needed. IIMB <-> NAW? Not direct. But maybe IIMB is a B-school. So relationship: IIMB <-> B-schools. But B-schools is not a specific entity. Might skip.\n\nGeos: Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore, Kolkata, Hyderabad are locations of NAW. So relationship: NAW <-> Delhi, NAW <-> Mumbai, etc. Also NAW <-> February? Not needed.\n\nEvents: NAW is event. IIMB SOP Prompt is event. Test Match cricket, ODI, T20, Gully Cricket are events. Relationship: IIMB SOP Prompt <-> Test Match cricket? Not. But maybe \"Test Match cricket\" is used as analogy. Not a relationship.\n\nWe can include relationships: NAW <-> IMS (organizer). NAW <-> Delhi (location). NAW <-> Mumbai. NAW <-> Chennai. NAW <-> Bangalore. NAW <-> Kolkata. NAW <-> Hyderabad. NAW <-> February (dates). IIMB <-> IIMB SOP Prompt (source). IIMB <-> B-schools? Might skip.\n\nAlso \"IIMB\" is an organization that provides SOP prompts. So relationship: IIMB <-> IIMB SOP Prompt. Also \"IIMB\" is a B-school. But B-schools is not a specific entity. Might skip.\n\nAlso \"IMS\" is organization that organizes NAW. So relationship: IMS <-> NAW.\n\nAlso \"IIMB\" is an organization that is part of B-schools. Might skip.\n\nAlso \"IIMB\" is an organization that is part of \"IIMB SOP Prompt\" event. So relationship: IIMB <-> IIMB SOP Prompt.\n\nAlso \"IIMB\" is an organization that is part of \"IIMB SOP Prompt\" event. So relationship: IIMB <-> IIMB SOP Prompt.\n\nAlso \"IIMB\" is an organization that is part of \"IIMB SOP Prompt\" event. So relationship: IIMB <-> IIMB SOP Prompt.\n\nAlso \"IIMB\" is an organization that is part of \"IIMB SOP Prompt\" event. So relationship: IIMB <-> IIMB SOP Prompt.\n\nAlso \"IIMB\" is an organization that is part of \"IIMB SOP Prompt\" event. So relationship: IIMB <-> IIMB SOP Prompt.\n\nStop repeating.\n\nAlso \"IIMB\" is an organization that is part of \"IIMB SOP Prompt\" event. So relationship: IIMB <-> IIMB SOP Prompt.\n\nOk.\n\nAlso \"IIMB\" is an organization that is part of \"IIMB SOP Prompt\" event. So relationship: IIMB <-> IIMB SOP Prompt.\n\nOk.\n\nNow we need to produce output list with entities and relationships. Entities: IIMB, IMS, NAW, National Achievers Workshop, IIMB SOP Prompt, Test Match Cricket, ODI, T20, Gully Cricket, Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore, Kolkata, Hyderabad, February (maybe event). But February is a month, not event. Might skip.\n\nAlso \"IIMB SOP Prompt\" is an event. \"National Achievers Workshop\" is event. \"NAW\" is event. \"Test Match Cricket\" event. \"ODI\" event. \"T20\" event. \"Gully Cricket\" event.\n\nAlso \"IIMB\" organization. \"IMS\" organization. \"Delhi\" geo. \"Mumbai\" geo. \"Chennai\" geo. \"Bangalore\" geo. \"Kolkata\" geo. \"Hyderabad\" geo.\n\nNow relationships: NAW <-> IMS (organizer). NAW <-> Delhi (location). NAW <-> Mumbai. NAW <-> Chennai. NAW <-> Bangalore. NAW <-> Kolkata. NAW <-> Hyderabad. NAW <-> February (dates). IIMB <-> IIMB SOP Prompt (source). IIMB <-> B-schools? skip. IIMB <-> NAW? Not direct. But maybe IIMB is a B-school that encourages NAW? Not clear. Might skip.\n\nAlso \"IIMB SOP Prompt\" <-> Test Match Cricket? Not. But maybe \"Test Match Cricket\" is used as analogy. Not a relationship.\n\nAlso \"IIMB SOP Prompt\" <-> ODI? Not.\n\nOk.\n\nAlso \"IIMB\" <-> IMS? Not.\n\nOk.\n\nNow we need to assign relationship_strength numeric. We can assign 8 for strong relationships like organizer, location. 5 for moderate. 3 for weak.\n\nNow produce output.\n\nWe need to format each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\nEntity description: comprehensive description of attributes and activities.\n\nLet's craft.\n\nEntity: IIMB - organization. Description: Indian Institute of Management Bangalore, a premier business school in India, provides MBA programs and SOP prompts for admissions.\n\nEntity: IMS - organization. Description: Indian Management Society, an organization that organizes the National Achievers Workshop (NAW) for MBA aspirants.\n\nEntity: NAW - event. Description: National Achievers Workshop, a two-weekend event held across six Indian cities to help MBA aspirants prepare for interviews and panel discussions.\n\nEntity: NATIONAL ACHIEVERS WORKSHOP - event. Actually NAW is the same. We can keep NAW.\n\nEntity: IIMB SOP Prompt - event.

Description: Capital city of India, one of the six cities hosting NAW.\n\nEntity: MUMBAI - geo. Description: Major metropolitan city in western India, one of the six cities hosting NAW.\n\nEntity: CHENNAI - geo. Description: Major city in southern India, one of the six cities hosting NAW.\n\nEntity: BANGALORE - geo. Description: City in southern India, home to IIMB, one of the six cities hosting NAW.\n\nEntity: KOLKATA - geo. Description: City in eastern India, one of the six cities hosting NAW.\n\nEntity: HYDERABAD - geo. Description: City in southern India, one of the six cities hosting NAW.\n\nNow relationships:\n\n1.

Not necessary.\n\nOk.\n\nNow produce output list with all entities and relationships separated by ##.\n\nLet's produce.\n\n"}}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 3815, "prompt_tokens": 2905, "total_tokens": 6720, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null}}}
