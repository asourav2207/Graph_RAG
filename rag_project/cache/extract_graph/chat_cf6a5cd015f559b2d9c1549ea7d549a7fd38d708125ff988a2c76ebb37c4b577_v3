For succession: We need to stop.", "reasoning_content": "We need to produce entities and relationships. Entity types: organization, person, geo, event. The text: Apple, Cupertino, California, Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, Ronald Wayne, Tim Cook, iPhone, MacBooks, iPads, Apple Watch, Microsoft, Bill Gates, Paul Allen, Satya Nadella, Google, Larry Page, Sergey Brin, Sundar Pichai. Also maybe \"smartphone industry\" but that's not an entity type. \"Apple\" is organization. \"Tim Cook\" person. \"Steve Jobs\" person. \"Steve Wozniak\" person. \"Ronald Wayne\" person. \"Apple Watch\" product but not entity type. \"iPhone\" product. \"MacBooks\" product. \"iPads\" product. \"Microsoft\" organization. \"Bill Gates\" person. \"Paul Allen\" person. \"Satya Nadella\" person. \"Google\" organization. \"Larry Page\" person. \"Sergey Brin\" person. \"Sundar Pichai\" person. \"Cupertino\" geo. \"California\" geo. \"smartphone industry\" event? Not event. \"technology company\" not entity. \"Apple\" is organization. \"Microsoft\" organization. \"Google\" organization. \"Apple\" founded by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, Ronald Wayne. \"Tim Cook succeeded Steve Jobs in 2011.\" \"Apple created iPhone.\" \"Apple also makes MacBooks, iPads, Apple Watch.\" \"Microsoft founded by Bill Gates, Paul Allen.\" \"Satya Nadella current CEO.\" \"Google founded by Larry Page, Sergey Brin.\" \"Sundar Pichai CEO.\" So relationships: Apple - founded by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, Ronald Wayne. Apple - headquartered in Cupertino, California. Apple - current CEO Tim Cook. Apple - created iPhone. Apple - makes MacBooks, iPads, Apple Watch. Tim Cook - succeeded Steve Jobs. Microsoft - founded by Bill Gates, Paul Allen. Microsoft - current CEO Satya Nadella. Google - founded by Larry Page, Sergey Brin. Google - current CEO Sundar Pichai. Also maybe \"Steve Jobs\" - co-founder of Apple. \"Steve Wozniak\" - co-founder. \"Ronald Wayne\" - co-founder. \"Bill Gates\" - co-founder. \"Paul Allen\" - co-founder. \"Larry Page\" - co-founder. \"Sergey Brin\" - co-founder. \"Sundar Pichai\" - CEO. \"Satya Nadella\" - CEO. \"Tim Cook\" - CEO. \"Apple\" - technology company. \"Microsoft\" - technology company. \"Google\" - technology company. \"Cupertino\" - city. \"California\" - state. \"Apple\" - headquartered in Cupertino, California. \"Apple\" - created iPhone. \"iPhone\" - product. \"MacBooks\" product. \"iPads\" product. \"Apple Watch\" product. But product not entity type. So we might not include them. But we can include them as organization? No. So we only include entity types: organization, person, geo, event. So we exclude products. So we will not include iPhone, MacBooks, iPads, Apple Watch. But we might include \"smartphone industry\" as event? Not event. So we exclude. So we have 3 organizations: Apple, Microsoft, Google. 9 persons: Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, Ronald Wayne, Tim Cook, Bill Gates, Paul Allen, Satya Nadella, Larry Page, Sergey Brin, Sundar Pichai. Actually 10 persons. 2 geo: Cupertino, California. Possibly \"technology company\" not entity. So we have 3 org, 10 person, 2 geo. We need to produce relationships. Relationship pairs: Apple - Steve Jobs (founder). Apple - Steve Wozniak (founder). Apple - Ronald Wayne (founder). Apple - Tim Cook (current CEO). Apple - Cupertino (headquartered). Apple - California (headquartered). Tim Cook - Steve Jobs (succeeded). Microsoft - Bill Gates (founder). Microsoft - Paul Allen (founder). Microsoft - Satya Nadella (current CEO). Google - Larry Page (founder). Google - Sergey Brin (founder). Google - Sundar Pichai (current CEO). Also maybe \"Steve Jobs\" - co-founder of Apple. But that's same as Apple - Steve Jobs. So we can include symmetrical? We can include only one direction. But we can include both directions? The example shows only one direction. So we will produce relationships as source_entity, target_entity. We can choose source as person, target as organization. Or organization to person. In example, they used source as person, target as organization for \"MARTIN SMITH\" to \"CENTRAL INSTITUTION\". So we can follow that pattern: person to organization. For \"Tim Cook\" to \"Apple\". For \"Steve Jobs\" to \"Apple\". For \"Steve Wozniak\" to \"Apple\". For \"Ronald Wayne\" to \"Apple\". For \"Bill Gates\" to \"Microsoft\". For \"Paul Allen\" to \"Microsoft\". For \"Larry Page\" to \"Google\". For \"Sergey Brin\" to \"Google\". For \"Satya Nadella\" to \"Microsoft\". For \"Sundar Pichai\" to \"Google\". For \"Apple\" to \"Cupertino\" (organization to geo). For \"Apple\" to \"California\" (organization to geo). For \"Tim Cook\" to \"Steve Jobs\" (person to person). For \"Satya Nadella\" to \"Microsoft\" (person to organization). But we already have that. For \"Sundar Pichai\" to \"Google\". For \"Tim Cook\" to \"Apple\" we have. For \"Steve Jobs\" to \"Apple\" we have. For \"Steve Wozniak\" to \"Apple\" we have. For \"Ronald Wayne\" to \"Apple\" we have. For \"Bill Gates\" to \"Microsoft\" we have. For \"Paul Allen\" to \"Microsoft\" we have. For \"Larry Page\" to \"Google\" we have. For \"Sergey Brin\" to \"Google\" we have. For \"Satya Nadella\" to \"Microsoft\" we have. For \"Sundar Pichai\" to \"Google\" we have. For \"Tim Cook\" to \"Steve Jobs\" we have. For \"Steve Jobs\" to \"Tim Cook\"? Not necessary. For \"Apple\" to \"Cupertino\" we have. For \"Apple\" to \"California\" we have. For \"Microsoft\" to \"Cupertino\"? No. For \"Google\" to \"Cupertino\"? No. For \"Steve Jobs\" to \"Cupertino\"? No. So we have 12 relationships. We need relationship_strength numeric. We can assign high for founder relationships: 9.
